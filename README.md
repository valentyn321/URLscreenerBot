# How to use this bot?
First of all, we need to install our virtual enviroment:
```shell
python3 -m venv env
```
Don't forget to activate it:
```shell
source env/bin/activate (on Linux)
```
Then install all dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Be sure, that webdriver is installed, and path contains it (env/bin). If webdriver is absent, you can download it from (for Mozilla):

After that, you can run the bot:
```shell

```
